#A/B Testing
#
Independent varialbles are the things we are controllingself.
Which version of the site they are being sent to view
Dependent varilables are what results from thisself.
Dependent varilable is the measure, the # of distinct pages viewed is our dependent within an A/B test.

Variable Types:
-Subject varilable as a factor, this is categorical or nominal Variable
-Continous or scalar which is quantitative
-Ordinal, 1-7 scale , ordering short, medium, tall, or tallest etcself.

*They should effect the type of analysis that we should be doing.

Indepdendent variables can also be called factors and can take on values which are called levels of the factors
*Like the website, there are two levels in a A/ B testing, site and site b

Between subjects and within subjects

Between subjects:
-Each subject only experiences only one or level of that factor, experience either website a or website b but not both
-Within subjects participants experience more than one factor, so they both experiehce site a and site b

If the difference between the results is big we probably odn't need more data, if it's small we need more to gain better insightsself.
